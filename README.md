### Tools we will use
We chosen to use Python as our programming language, Dataspell as our IDE and Tableau to visualise our findings

### Data set
These are the data set that we will be dealing with

### EDA
First we will do our Eexploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights on the data through Univariate Analysis and Bivariate Analysis
